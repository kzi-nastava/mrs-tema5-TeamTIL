TILTaxi is a full-stack ride-sharing application.  
The system is designed to simplify urban transportation by reducing direct interaction between passengers and drivers, thereby improving safety, consistency, and overall efficiency.

## User Roles

The system supports four types of users.

Unregistered users can access the application landing page where they are able to view active vehicles on the map and get an estimation of ride duration and price by selecting a pickup location and destination.

Registered users (passengers) can request immediate or scheduled rides, define multiple stops and favorite routes, track rides in real time, and receive notifications about ride status changes. They can view their ride history, generate reports, rate drivers and vehicles, use the PANIC button during rides, manage their profile information, and communicate with support through live chat.

Drivers are automatically assigned rides based on availability and proximity. They can manage their active/inactive status, start, cancel, or complete rides with a mandatory reason when required, monitor their working hours (with a daily limit of 8 hours), view ride history and reports, use the PANIC button in emergency situations, and update profile information subject to administrator approval.

Administrators oversee the entire system by managing users, drivers, and vehicles, monitoring ongoing rides in real time, handling PANIC alerts, generating global and individual reports, managing ride pricing, blocking users when necessary, and providing 24/7 live chat support.
